# Intro
This folder of the Monero site repository is set up so anyone who wants to help write copy for the Monero website has a place to submit requested changes before the website goes live. After the new website is up, the copy must be changed in the site itself on the official Monero Project repository.

**If you're looking for the wire and analogous pages for the Home, Downloads, News, Hall of Fame, or The Monero Project pages, go to the bottom of this document.**

# Instructions

1. Look on the [sitemap](http://imgur.com/8BkJF1o) to identify the page you want to write copy for.
2. Navigate to the correct top-level navigation item folder in this repository.
3. Find the page you want to work on in the readme of the folder.
4. View the provided page wire and analogous current webpage.
5. Open your file of choice and write your copy in the correct section.

**Please look at the sitemap to find the page you want to write for. If it's not on the sitemap, it's not on the site.**

# A bit more detail
For each top-level navigation item there is a folder. The pages that do not belong in any of the folders (i.e. home, the monero project, and downloads) have their own file in copy folder. Please navigate to the folder housing the file you want to work with and read the readme provided.

The readme of each folder provides important information, such as the wire for the invdividual pages, as well as any analogous page on the current getmonero.org website. You can use the current page as a starting ground to work from. *You must view the wire of the page to get an understanding for where you copy will be going.*

Every file is segmented with different header tags denoting which section of the page that copy will be going into. To see where the sections will be placed, please check the wire for that page.
