# Subheading

The Monero project is devoted to the development of Monero, a privacy oriented cryptocurrency based on the CryptoNote protocol. It uses proven open source technology to obfuscate the blockchain, keeping you, and others safe through anonymity.

# Kovri

The Kovri project uses end-to-end encryption so that neither the sender nor receiver of a Monero transaction need to reveal their IP address to the other side or to third-party observers (the blockchain). This is done using the same technology that powers the dark net, i2p (Invisible Internet Protocol). The project is currently in heavy, active development and is not yet integrated with Monero.

# OpenAlias

The OpenAlias project simplifies cryptocurrency payments by providing FQDNs (Fully Qualified Domain Names, i.e. example.openalias.org) for Monero wallet addresses in a way that ensures everyone's privacy is secure. The project is well underway and has already been implemented in many Monero wallets.
