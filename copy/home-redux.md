# Why Monero is different

## Monero is the leading cryptocurrency with a focus on private and censorship-resistant transactions.
Almost all cryptcurrencies are transparent. They reveal your entire transaction history to the world.

Monero uses uniquely designed cryptography to ensure that no one can see how much money you have or where you spend it unless you allow them to, even if they know your wallet address.

## Monero transactions are confidential and untraceable
Always-on privacy means that eveery Monero user's activity enhances the privacy of everyone else. 

Because funds on the Monero blockchain are untraceable, they cannot become taited by association with their previous owners. This means you don't have to worry about blacklisted coins that you can't spend or exchange. 

## Monero is a grassroots community attracting cryptocurrencies researchers and engineers
Monero is not a corporation. It is developed by volunteer cryptography and distributed systems experts from all over the world. This means that Monero can't be shut down by any one country and is not under any particular legal jurisdiction.

Over 240 developers are constantly pushing the frontier of what is possible with cryptocurrency privacy and security by contributing to the Monero Project. Community forums and chat channels are active and welcoming.

## Monero is electronic cash that allows fast, inexpensive payments to and from anywhere in the world
There are no multi-day holding periods and no risk of fraudulent chargebacks. It is safe from ‘capital controls’. These are measures that restrict the flow of traditional currencies, sometimes to an extreme degree, in countries experiencing economic instability.
