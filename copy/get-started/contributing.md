# Contributing to Monero

Monero is an open source, *community* driven project. We strive to be a welcoming community. Perhaps you want to contribute?

## Forum Funding System

Monero utilizes a Forum Funding System (FFS) which encourages people of all backgrounds to be a part of Monero and maybe even *get paid* for it. Anyone can suggest an idea, ask for funding, and immediately start making the idea happen. As progress is made payments are released and Monero flourishes.  There is a General Fund which is used to add features to Monero, improve services, build better websites, and even market Monero.  You can also donate directly to individual projects.  Take a look and don't be afraid to jump right in with an idea or a donation.

## Donating

Ongoing development of the Monero Project is solely supported by donations and sponsors. At this time the project is vastly underfunded, and thus donations are greatly appreciated.

If you would like to make a donation you can do so by using any of the methods below:

### Attend a Meetup
Talking with people online is nice and all, but sometimes it's enjoyable to chat with people in person. See the list of upcoming events here. If nothing is happening around you, it's easy to start something yourself! Just meet with local enthusiasts at a bar and chat.

### Run a Full Node
Run monerod with port 18080 open. This will help your node distribute copies of the blockchain to other nodes on the network.

### Mine
From the GUI and CLI, there is an option to start mining. This is a great way to protect the decentralization of the network. If you have a powerful graphics card or hope to mine for profit, see more advanced options in the [MoneroMining subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/MoneroMining).
